            <h2 class="title title-group">POEMS <em>from the INNER LANDSCAPE of a</em> Psych Nurse</h2>
            <section>
                <h2 class="title title-heading">THE GROUP</h2>

                <p>Group met three times a week. In-Patient Psychiatric Unit. Criteria: chronic
                    mental illness.</p>

                <p>As leader of the group, I became a constant in their lives. They trusted me to
                    climb inside and look outside their window.</p>

                <p>Four members of the group remain part of my internal tapestry.</p>

                <p>Stan looms larger than the rest. He&rsquo;d tried to shoot himself and blew off
                    half his face. Sadistic voices stalked his psyche, refusing to be silenced by
                    drugs or ECT. Stan shared my passion for poetry. In a deeply sensuous Scottish
                    brogue, he would recite the work of Dylan Thomas without a trace of madness.</p>

                <p>Izzy was an orthodox Jew, complete with tallit and tattered tzitzit. He&rsquo;d
                    survived a Nazi concentration camp, but his paranoid delusions held him captive.
                    As soon as Izzy sensed religious ridicule, his arms became machetes and blasts
                    of rapid-fire Yiddish assaulted anyone who dared cross his path. The only thing
                    that soothed his soul was the sound of Mozart&rsquo;s violin sonatas. Upon his
                    arrival and exit from the group he gravely genuflected, shook each
                    person&rsquo;s hand and softly said, &ldquo;Shalom.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>June was thirty when I met her. At thirteen she ran away from home. At fourteen
                    she was turning tricks to live. Syphilis untreated claimed her fragile mind and
                    left her childlike, with no impulse control and the scent of selfless
                    generosity. The group tried to protect her from her aching vulnerability, but
                    her hunger for physical affection drove her to seek solace wherever she could
                    find it. Despite the growing gaps in her cognition, she sang every Sunday in a
                    choir. At Christmas she performed &ldquo;O Holy Night&rdquo; as if it had been
                    written just for her.</p>

                <p>Earl was just nineteen, the baby of the group. Autistic Savant Disorder with
                    severe obsessive-compulsive traits overshadowed his superior intellect. Rigid
                    rituals ruled his life. Each day he&rsquo;d walk the same set routes, the same
                    set number of times, until his soles were shredded, his feet were festering. He
                    often spoke in iambic pentameter and Shakespearean soliloquies were featured in
                    his compulsive patterns of speech. When tensions in the group arose, he&rsquo;d
                    twirl three times, stand up on his chair and with astonishing aplomb deliver
                    these familiar lines: &ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strain&rsquo;d. It
                    droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath&#8230;.&rdquo;</p>


            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="title title-heading">FIRST MORNING &ndash; LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY</h2>

                <p>She woke up in a strange room. Her mind felt woolly at first. They had given her
                    a sleeping pill last night and she had never taken one before. Then she
                    discovered to her horror that they had diapered her without her CONSENT. Was she
                    demented? No. History of incontinence? No. Ambulatory? Yes, used a cane. Was the
                    diaper for them? or her? Abuse?</p>

                <p>The nurse assigned to her came in and told her it was her morning to have a
                    shower. Her response was: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I can only take baths. I
                    found my husband dead in the shower three years ago and now I can&rsquo;t even
                    look at or hear a shower without having a panic attack. I&rsquo;m sure it was
                    flagged in my admission note.&rdquo; In a voice that sounded sickly sweet and
                    condescending her nurse replied: &ldquo;Come on now honey&#8230;. don&rsquo;t
                    get all fussy on me. I promise I will stay right with you the whole time.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>As soon as the nurse started to remove her nightgown, she began screaming and
                    kicking. &ldquo;NO! You don&rsquo;t GET it. It&rsquo;s not about preference. I
                    CAN&rsquo;T do it!!&rdquo; Two more nurses ran in and she felt the sharp, cold
                    sting of a needle pierce the skin of her left buttock. Was the needle for them?
                    or her? Assault?</p>

                <h2 class="title title-heading"> THICK VS. THIN</h2>

                <p>Her whole life she&rsquo;d been told to develop thick skin, as if personality
                    transplants were sold at the mall. When first told she was too young for
                    metaphors, she thought to herself, elephants are my favorite animal but
                    I&rsquo;ll keep my thin skin.</p>

                <p>For too many years she&rsquo;d worked in mental health, watching too many nurses
                    acquire thick skin. Their cynicism eroded their capacity for compassion.
                    Experience taught her they suffered from feeling too much before too little.</p>

                <p>As a poet she concedes she might be quicker to learn from constructive criticism
                    if her skin were thicker, but when she&rsquo;s pregnant with a poem, rejection
                    resembles a miscarriage.</p>

                <p>She chewed on the tendency to associate thick skin with courage, then
                    acknowledged she&rsquo;d come to believe the opposite. Courage was more about
                    honouring her fallibility and that of humankind.</p>

                <p>Now that she&rsquo;s faced and embraced her thin skin, she&rsquo;ll move on to
                    morosely consider the thickness of her waist.</p>

                <h2 class="title title-heading">SURFACING</h2>

                <p>She had learned to stay with her sadness. Swim down with the current of her
                    feelings. If she bathed them in softly scented self-kindness, beneficent
                    stillness, made no attempt to fix or cure them she could hear the healing
                    language of her spirit, weave its wisdom in with her braid and swim to the
                    surface.</p>

                <p></p>

                <h2 class="title title-heading">JEN</h2>

                <p>Jen&rsquo;s story, my part in it, is deeply engraved on a tombstone in the
                    cemetery of my mind.</p>

                <p>We first met when I hired her as a staff nurse because she had it all &ndash;
                    compassion, humour, knowledge and leadership potential.</p>

                <p>Four years later a severe psychotic break brought tragic consequences &ndash;
                    hospitalizations, heroin addiction, working the street and living on it.</p>

                <p>Another four years had passed when I saw her next. Jen sat across from me flanked
                    by two union reps to set up a &ldquo;Return to Work Program.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Jen had fought with every ounce of her being to get her life together. She now
                    met the regulations specified in the Collective Agreement and had a letter from
                    her psychiatrist certifying she was clean and mentally competent. But my gut was
                    screaming &ldquo;You idiots&#8230;she doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance in
                    hell!&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Her hands had been scrubbed raw with bleach but her fingertips and nails were
                    stained the mustard brown of someone who chain smoked unfiltered, roll-your-owns
                    down to the quick. Her forearms still bore the tell-tale scars of once infected
                    puncture wounds and dark, worm like track marks. She answered questions
                    appropriately, but her face seemed partly frozen and her voice was devoid of
                    inflection. Occasionally she cocked her head sideways, as if listening to
                    something.</p>

                <p>The union reps were reputed to have replaced their brains with the Collective
                    Agreement and would never back down. I felt trapped&#8230;anything I said would
                    lead to grievances, charges of negative bias. I caved&#8230; Jen would start
                    with four-hour shifts and work closely with an experienced buddy nurse.</p>

                <p>At the end of her first four-hour shift, Jen&rsquo;s buddy nurse called me to say
                    Jen had overheard their shared patient ask her not to give him Jen as his nurse
                    again &#8230; &ldquo;She scares me, she&rsquo;s nice but too weird&#8230; has
                    this crazed look in her eyes.&rdquo; Jen took off without her winter coat.</p>

                <p> A few hours later, the community cops found her dead; a needle was still stuck
                    in her arm, a plastic bag was pulled over her head and knotted tightly around
                    her neck.</p>

                <p>symptoms cover up unconscious sinkholes open me first</p>

                <p>your mirror inquires who is this impostor answerless anguish</p>

                <p>days are soiled by soul-crushing inner critics &ldquo;get over
                    yourself&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

                <p>dissociation or &ldquo;dearly departed&rdquo; is your defense of choice</p>

                <p>&ldquo;dearly departed&rdquo; you step into traffic horns blast you awake THE
                    DOCTOR NURSE GAME &ndash; AN UPDATE</p>

                <p>nurses who&rsquo;ve pronounced the game dead no longer work the front line</p>

                <p>many docs are still stuck in impoverished perspectives that separate the mind
                    from the body and ignore trauma-informed practices</p>

                <p>nurses still swim in superior intuitive knowledge but drown in doc envy</p>

                <p>the potential for balance gets lost in the dance of dominance</p>

                <p>more education and freedom for nurses didn&rsquo;t end abuse from docs</p>

                <p>docs absorb years of shaming from senior staff during and after their training</p>

                <p>no surprise some act out the clich&eacute; &ldquo;The oppressed shall be the
                    oppressors&rdquo;</p>

                <p>bullying in nursing is common and has fed the hateful adage &ldquo;nurses eat
                    their own&rdquo;</p>

                <p>if they continue to look up instead of within for definition and meaningful
                    connection the ball is in play PERMISSION TO WEEP</p>

                <p>As always, she let herself in the back door. I looked up at my friend and froze
                    in my place. Her eyes appeared vacant, emptied of life. She advised in a voice
                    bereft of expression: &ldquo;David is dead&#8230;no he&rsquo;s not just dead, he
                    jumped in front of The West Coast Express. Tell them not to call me a suicide
                    survivor. We discussed it one time. The correct term is suicide griever.&rdquo;
                    She walked over to the sink, vomited, then she sat down.</p>

                <p>Hunched over, she hugged herself fiercely, while rocking back and forth and
                    tunelessly singing a Simon and Garfunkel song: &ldquo;Slip out the back, Jack.
                    Get a new plan, Stan. Step on the bus, Gus. We don&rsquo;t need to discuss
                    much.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>At first, I defaulted to years of learned language. &ldquo;People often want not
                    to die but to stop living. If an in-between place existed&#8230; they&rsquo;d
                    take it. The pain of depression warps their thinking. I mean we wouldn&rsquo;t
                    blame a heart patient for chest pain.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>I shoved my psychobabble back in its can.</p>

                <p>Suicide hijacks our world made of words. It strips us stark naked, then stalks
                    us, crawling inside to chew chunks off our soul. Unfixable suffering leaks from
                    soul lesions that never stop stinking of stigma.</p>

                <p>Molly, my golden retriever, awoke from her nap. Sensing something sorely amiss,
                    she made straight for my friend. With a front paw planted right up on each
                    shoulder, she proceeded to bathe her paralyzed face in slobbery dogged devotion.</p>

                <p>Molly&rsquo;s message managed to penetrate her pain, granting my friend
                    permission to weep.</p>

                <p class="title title-heading"> SEVEN-LAYER SALAD</p>

                <p>She was always quite contained, but completely came undone when her colleague
                    brought a Seven-Layer Salad to her farewell potluck luncheon.</p>

                <p>Her colleague was also an ex-lover who&rsquo;d betrayed her, but it was many
                    years ago. She knew his contribution carried no intent to harm. The rancorous
                    smell of unfinished business no longer lingered in the air.</p>

                <p>The shame storm that hit her broad-side, without so much as a small craft
                    warning, defied her conscious mind.</p>

                <p>Later she remembered her mother had never tossed a salad (far too random). She
                    obsessively divided the ingredients, then layered them into seven equal parts.</p>

                <p>When she was only four years old she developed Crohn&rsquo;s, a serious
                    inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

                <p> Although fully toilet trained at two years old, her beleaguered little body lost
                    the battle for control.</p>

                <p>One afternoon, when her mother was serving up her severed salad to her bridge
                    club ladies, she overheard her mother tell them how horrible her daughter
                    smelled&#8230; Her mother&rsquo;s betrayal cut much deeper than her
                    Crohn&rsquo;s.</p>

                <p>As her profoundly troubled mind re-played the hideous scene, she imagined the
                    familiar voice of her beloved Jungian analyst, now deceased, whispering a
                    familiar refrain &#8230; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have an unconscious. It has us.
                    Repressed memories nest within our shadow and then with perfect timing
                    re-surface to bite us in the ass.&rdquo;</p>
